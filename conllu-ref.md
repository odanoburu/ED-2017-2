doubt: why so? if this tagging is done regardless of sentence-specific
behaviour, why include it in every sentence instead of having a db
where it can be looked up when needed?

> The universal POS tags should capture regular, prevailing syntactic
> behavior, as well as morphological characteristics when available,
> and should not reflect sentence-specific exceptional behavior. In
> particular, the POS tags do not distinguish actual usage of a word
> from just mentioning it. Thus in both the following examples, yes
> will be tagged as interjection:

> Yes, I think so.  

> I am waiting for his ‘yes’ on the matter.

> Similarly, in both the following examples, precede will be tagged as
> verb:
>
> Such discussion must precede every decision.  

> He pronounced ‘precede’ in a funny way.
